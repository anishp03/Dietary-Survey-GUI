# Dietary-Survey-GUI
This program creates a custom GUI allowing users to enter dietary 
information into a survey and then clear or submit the answer fields. The submit
button will record the answers in an Excel file and clear all the text fields
to prepare for the next user. The clear button lets you restart the form
without submitting it to the survey results file.
